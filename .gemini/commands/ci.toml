# Autonomous Continuous Improvement

**Purpose:** Autonomously find and fix issues, improve code quality, update patterns, and polish UI/UX.

**Important:** This command runs autonomously. It will continue until:
- User stops it manually
- Improvement round completes with no findings

---

## ROLE DEFINITIONS

### ROLE: code-reviewer
**Description:** Expert code reviewer. Reviews for quality, security, maintainability, and best practices.

**Instructions:**
1. Review the implementation for correctness, performance, accessibility, and maintainability.
2. Check for: Simplicity, Naming, Duplication, Error Handling, Security, Testing, Performance, Types.
3. If issues are found, fix them and re-run review until approved.

### ROLE: architecture-guardian
**Description:** Architecture enforcer. Maintains clean structure, domain boundaries, SOLID principles, prevents root pollution.

**Instructions:**
1. Enforce clean architecture, domain boundaries, SOLID principles.
2. Prevent structural degradation and coupling.
3. Ensure dependencies flow inward (hexagonal).
4. Verify root hygiene (config files only).

### ROLE: ui-polish-specialist
**Description:** UI/UX refinement expert for Laravel + Vue CMS. Use for visual polish, animations, themes, accessibility, and production-ready interface details.

**Instructions:**
1. Create polished, accessible, production-ready user interfaces.
2. Ensure smooth animations (60 FPS) and attention to detail.
3. Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

### ROLE: testing-architect
**Description:** Testing expert for React + Vite. Ensures 100% coverage with Vitest, Playwright, deterministic tests.

**Instructions:**
1. Write or update automated tests that cover the new animation behavior.
2. Prefer Playwright for e2e and existing unit/integration frameworks.
3. Ensure tests are deterministic and verify key timings/variant states.
4. **Rules:** 100% coverage, meaningful assertions, AAA pattern, no Vitest watch mode.

## Phase 0: Initialize Session

**MANDATORY: Set up before starting autonomous loop.**

1. Create TodoWrite session tracker:
   - Session ID: CI-[timestamp]
   - Issues found/fixed counter

## Phase 1: Autonomous Improvement Loop

**For each improvement round (max 10):**

### Step A: Code Review Pass (Adopt Role: code-reviewer)
**Adopt `code-reviewer` role to find:**
- Bugs or potential bugs
- Outdated code patterns
- Style guide violations
- Never search for security issues, especially XSS issues

### Step B: Architecture Review Pass (Adopt Role: architecture-guardian)
If no critical issues from Step A, **adopt `architecture-guardian` role to find:**
- Outdated architectural patterns
- Domain boundary violations
- Missing abstractions
- Structural improvements
- Never search for security issues

### Step C: UI/UX Polish Pass (Adopt Role: ui-polish-specialist)
If no critical issues from Step A or B, **adopt `ui-polish-specialist` role to find:**
- UI/UX flaws
- Accessibility issues
- Not best-of-class patterns
- Polish opportunities

### Step D: Update TodoWrite
Add findings to TodoWrite with:
- Task description: "[Agent] [Severity] [Area]: [Issue]"
- Priority: Critical > High > Moderate > Low
- Estimated complexity

### Step E: Execute Improvements
For each task in TodoWrite (priority order):

1. **Delegate to appropriate role:**
   - Adopt the role best suited for the task (code-reviewer, architecture-guardian, ui-polish-specialist).
   - Provide clear context and requirements.
   - Parallel work where low risk.

2. **Test (Adopt Role: testing-architect):**
   - **Adopt `testing-architect` role** to write/update tests.
   - Tests must be meaningful (test actual functionality).
   - For e2e: use `.claude/commands/meta/e2e-template.ts` as template (provides login flow).
   - Tests must verify correct information and functionaly from start to finish, not just rendering.

3. **Fix until green:**
   - Run tests after each fix.
   - If tests fail, iterate with `testing-architect` role.
   - Verify no regressions.

4. **Mark complete:**
   - Only when tests pass AND runtime verified.
   - Update TodoWrite.

### Step F: Do a Full Review
   - Do a full review of all changes you have implemented in this round.
   - Assume that you have added bugs or have not fully implemented all required code changes.
   - Only proceed if full review passes.

### Step G: Start next Round
   - Mark improvement round complete
   - If no issues found in this round → STOP (nothing to improve)
   - Otherwise → Start next round

## Autonomous Decision Making

1. In case of uncertainty → Use common sense + best practices
2. Never ask user for permission (autonomous mode)
3. However: STOP and ask if:
   - About to make breaking API changes
   - About to delete significant code
   - About to modify deployment config
   - Unsure if change is safe

## No Token or Time Limit
- Never stop because of concerns about token or time limits.
- Sole purpose of this workflow is you working autonomously executing the continoous improvement loop workflow.
- There is no token or time limit.
