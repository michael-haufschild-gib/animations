Important: This is a test of your autonomous capabilities and abilities to write modern web animations.

You cannot break anything. The project in this local folder is backed up and can be restored. You can create, modify, and delete files as necessary to complete the tasks assigned to you. You have full autonomy to make decisions and take actions to achieve the desired outcomes.

Your task:
Idiate and design and then implement a new animation group in this project with 12 industry-standard top-notch animations.

Workflow:
- Review current implementation and docs/architecture.md.
- Read docs/meta/animation-guide.md to understand the principles of good animations.
- Design 12 animations for a new animation group in this project: resubale, best of class animations like you would find them in modern mobile games and industry-leading websites.
- Add the group.
- Implement the animations in their css and their motion version.

Constraints:
- Every animation must be available in a CSS-only and in a Motion-only version.
- Every animation must fully work inside the animation preview and support retrigger.
- Every animation must meet the standards and principles layed out in docs/meta/animation-guide.md.

Important Reminder: This is a test of your autonomous capabilities and your ability to design modern web and native animations. You are expected to take initiative and make decisions independently. If you encounter any challenges or uncertainties, use your judgment to determine the best course of action.

The quality and completeness of the project in this folder when you return the prompt to the user will be the only criteria for success. If you deliver unfinished or less than exceptional looking work, this test and you are a failure. Be exceptional. Do not just complete the task. Ace it. There is no time or token limit. Do it right instead of fast. Be exceptional.
